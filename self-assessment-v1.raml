  - title: Overview
    content: |
      This REST API allows clients to post information related to a taxpayer, and then get an estimated tax liability calculation for a tax period.

      This is for the April MVP.
  - title: Terminology
    content: |

      * A **Source Of Income** is something that can provide income to a taxpayer. This might be UK property, or an employment for example.
      * A **Summary** is the sum of transactions from a ledger. These are grouped by type (e.g. income or expenses), and by category (e.g. salary or rent).
      * A **Declaration** is created to declare that the source and summary information sent so far for the tax year are correct.

  - title: Workflow
    content: |
      A typical **update process** would be:

      1. Authenticate.
      1. Create any income **sources** you need (e.g. employment or property).
      1. Create **summaries** for any recent transactions.
      1. Update any **summaries** that need amending.
      1. Update any **sources** for the the current tax year, e.g. set allowances, adjustments, reliefs.
      1. Update any once per year details.
      1. Create a **declaration** to confirm the quartely update is complete
      1. Request a **liability** calculation.
      1. Wait for the calculation to complete.
      1. Get the liability and display it to your user.

      The **end of year process** would be the above, plus:

      1. At the end of the year, mark the tax year as complete.

      Sources and summaries will be given IDs. Do not expect these to be GUIDs. They will only be unique within context. I.e. source IDs will be unique for that type of source and within that self-assessment. Similarly, summary IDs will be unique for that type of summary within its source.

      You will need to store these IDs within your application for disambiguation and reconciliation.

  - title: Considerations
    content: |
      * We do not expect or want you to submit transaction level information (if fact, we may limit the amount of data you can send). How will you aggregate this information within your software?
      * How does your application deal with lost HTTP requests or responses?
      * How do you reconcile your data with our data?
      * The API doesn't expose meta-data or audit information (e.g. created or update times, who made the change). Do you need to record this audit information yourself?
      * Your application may not be the only application access and modifying a taxpayer's data. How would you differentiate different data from your application and others?
